GrainJS is a JavaScript / TypeScript library for building dynamic web applications.

- It's in part inspired by [React](https://reactjs.org/), but based on observables (like
[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)) instead of virtual dom.
- It is lightweight, has no dependencies, and takes only ~30KB minified.
- It needs no special tooling. It's nothing more than a library.
- It supports convenient DOM-building in JS, event dispatching, DOM event subscriptions,
  disposable components, and in-code CSS styling.
- It's fully typed for use with TypeScript.
- It's proven its worth by powering [Grist](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#grist)'s rich
  frontend app.
