Temperature calculator built using React, from React's own tutorial.

This demo was initially constructed with `npx create-react-app celsius_react`, then
unnecessary files were removed or stripped, and relevant code added.

To build and see this React-based demo in action, run in this directory:

```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
```

Then open file `build/index.html` in browser.
