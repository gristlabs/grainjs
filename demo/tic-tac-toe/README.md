# Tic-Tac-Toe using GrainJS

This is a demo based closely on React's tutorial at https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe.

It is a TypeScript version of the Tic-Tac-Toe demo in GrainJS documentation:
https://gristlabs.github.io/grainjs/examples.html#tic-tac-toe. That one has a preview that lets
you play Tic-Tac-Toe right in the documentation page, as well as a link to try it out on Codepen.

To build this demo and see it in action, run from project root:

```
npm run build-demo
```

Then open the file `demo/tic-tac-toe/index.html` in a browser.
