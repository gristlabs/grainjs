/**
 * dispose.js provides tools to objects that needs to dispose resources, such as destroy DOM, and
 * unsubscribe from events. The motivation with examples is presented here:
 *
 *    https://phab.getgrist.com/w/disposal/
 *
 * Disposable is a mixin class for components that need cleanup (e.g. maintain DOM, listen to
 * events, subscribe to anything). It provides a .dispose() method that should be called to
 * destroy the component, and .autoDispose() family of methods that the component should use to
 * take responsibility for other pieces that require cleanup.
 *
 * To define a disposable class (Base could be Object if no other base class is being extended):
 *    class Foo extends Disposable(Object) { ... }
 *    class Foo extends Disposable(Base) { ... }
 *
 * To create Foo:
 *    let foo = Foo.create(args...);
 * This is better than `new Foo` in that if the constructor throws an exception, any calls to
 * .autoDispose() that happened before the exception are honored.
 *
 * In Foo's constructor (or rarely methods), take ownership of other objects:
 *    this.bar = this.autoDispose(Bar.create(...));
 * The argument will get disposed when `this` is disposed using its `dispose` method. Other kinds
 * of objects may be disposable this way (e.g. DOM nodes when using a library that registers a
 * disposer for them using Disposable.registerDisposer).
 *
 * For more customized disposal:
 *    this.baz = this.autoDisposeWithMethod('destroy', new Baz());
 *    this.elem = this.autoDisposeWith(ko.cleanNode, document.createElement(...));
 * When `this` is disposed, it will call this.baz.destroy(), and ko.cleanNode(this.elem).
 *
 * To call another method on disposal (e.g. to add custom disposal logic):
 *    this.autoDisposeCallback(this.myUnsubscribeAllMethod);
 * The method will be called with `this` as context, and no arguments.
 *
 * To wipe out this object on disposal (i.e. set all properties to null):
 *    this.wipeOnDispose();
 * See the documentation of that method for more info.
 *
 * To dispose Foo:
 *    foo.dispose();
 * Owned objects will be disposed in reverse order from which `autoDispose` were called.
 *
 * To release an owned object:
 *    this.disposeRelease(this.bar);
 *
 * To dispose an owned object early:
 *    this.disposeDiscard(this.bar);
 *
 * To determine if an object has already been disposed:
 *    foo.isDisposed()
