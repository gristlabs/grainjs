/**
 * dispose.js provides tools to objects that needs to dispose resources, such as destroy DOM, and
 * unsubscribe from events. The motivation with examples is presented here:
 *
 *    https://phab.getgrist.com/w/disposal/
 *
 * Disposable is a class for components that need cleanup (e.g. maintain DOM, listen to events,
 * subscribe to anything). It provides a .dispose() method that should be called to destroy the
 * component, and .onDispose()/.autoDispose() methods that the component should use to take
 * responsibility for other pieces that require cleanup.
 *
 * To define a disposable class:
 *    class Foo extends Disposable { ... }
 *
 * To create Foo:
 *    const foo = Foo.create(owner, ...args);
 * This is better than `new Foo` for two reasons:
 *    1. If Foo's constructor throws an exception, any disposals registered in that constructor
 *       before the exception are honored.
 *    2. It ensures you specify the owner of the new instance (but you can use null to skip it).
 *
 * In Foo's constructor (or rarely methods), take ownership of other Disposable objects:
 *    this.bar = Bar.create(this, ...);
 *
 * For objects that are not instances of Disposable but have a .dispose() methods, use:
 *    this.bar = this.autoDispose(createSomethingDisposable());
 *
 * To call a function on disposal (e.g. to add custom disposal logic):
 *    this.onDispose(() => this.myUnsubscribeAllMethod());
 *    this.onDispose(this.myUnsubscribeAllMethod, this);    // slightly more efficient
 *
 * To mark this object to be wiped out on disposal (i.e. set all properties to null):
 *    this.wipeOnDispose();
 * See the documentation of that method for more info.
 *
 * To dispose Foo directly:
 *    foo.dispose();
 * To determine if an object has already been disposed:
 *    foo.isDisposed()
 *
 * If you need to replace an owned object, or release, or dispose it early, use a Holder:
 *    this._holder = Holder.create(this);
 *    Bar.create(this._holder, 1);      // creates new Bar(1)
 *    Bar.create(this._holder, 2);      // creates new Bar(2) and disposes previous object
 *    this._holder.clear();             // disposes contained object
 *    this._holder.release();           // releases contained object
 *
 * If creating your own class with a dispose() method, do NOT throw exceptions from dispose().
 * These cannot be handled properly in all cases. Read here about the same issue in C++:
 *    http://bin-login.name/ftp/pub/docs/programming_languages/cpp/cffective_cpp/MAGAZINE/SU_FRAME.HTM#destruct
 *
 * Using a parametrized (generic) class as a Disposable is tricky. E.g.
 *    class Bar<T> extends Disposable { ... }
 *    // Bar<T>.create(...)   <-- doesn't work
 *    // Bar.create<T>(...)   <-- doesn't work
 *    // Bar.create(...)      <-- works, but with {} for Bar's type parameters
 *
 * The solution is to expose the constructor type using a helper method:
 *    class Bar<T> extends Disposable {
 *      // Note the tuple below which must match the constructor parameters of Bar<U>.
 *      public static ctor<U>(): IDisposableCtor<Bar<U>, [U, boolean]> { return this; }
 *      constructor(a: T, b: boolean) { ... }
 *    }
 *    Bar.ctor<T>().create(...)   // <-- works, creates Bar<T>, and does type-checking!
