## Testing Types

This directory contains test of TypeScript typings, to ensure they allow correct constructs and
disallow incorrect ones, and provide helpful type inference.

The tool used for testing typings is [dtslint](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint). See
https://hackernoon.com/testing-types-an-introduction-to-dtslint-b178f9b18ac8 for an introduction
on using dtslint for testing types.
